    <h1>People, work with me…</h1>
    <h2>Production Background</h2>
    <p>Well honestly, I have none, not professional anyway. It all started when I was 11. That's when my uncle Richard, who owns Glasswing Studios, got me involved in recording music. You can read more about that in my <a href="pharaoh.html">Bio</a>.</p>
    <h3>Danger Is Here</h3>
    <p><strong>Danger Is Here</strong> – Elliot Scott<br>
    I have just recently wrapped production on the Case Records release of <em>Danger Is Here</em>, written and performed by Elliot Scott. It's an eclectic mix of Goth, New Wave and Funk that, as Scott says, "...brings the digital heartbeat of a funk pacemaker, combining the electronic with the organic...".</p>
    <p>For me it was a brand new style of music to produce. Scott brought in loop based tracks with vocals recorded through the built-in microphone on his laptop. I would import all the tracks, clean them up, re-arrange them and in some cases, re-record them if I needed more control. I also added live bass and keys and programmed many of the drum tracks to give the pieces a less loop based feel. Along the way Scott and a bottle of Sailor Jerry would come over to my attic to re-record the vocal tracks.</p>
    <p>I met Scott when my daughter started kindergarten at the same school his son attended 1<sup>st</sup> grade. I invited him to a party at my house where he saw my attic studio. He nearly fell over when he saw my Motif 8. He played one of his tunes from his mp3 player that I plugged into my mixing board. I thought to myself, "I should work with this guy". A year later, <em>Danger Is Here</em> was released.</p>
    <p>You can buy it in local Buffalo music stores and online from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com">iTunes</a> and <a href="https://cdbaby.com">CDBaby</a>. You can also hear the entire CD on <a href="https://soundclick.com">SoundClick.com</a>.</p>
    <h3>Headphones Required</h3>
    <p><strong>Headphones Required</strong> – The Mietus Bros.<br>
    What can I say. It's the Mietus Bros. I went to high school with Brian back in the '80's. That's when we started rappin' together. Years later he brought his brother Jeff over and we started holdin' "Monday Night Raps", an off-the-cuff rap session where I'd supply the beats and they supplied the rhymes &amp; beer &amp; ... We didn't have the equipment to record back then, maybe a cassette tape or two, but nothing special.</p>
    <p>Then in the early 2000's my equipment and recording process had greatly improved so we began work on <em>Headphones Required</em>. Still using the off-cuff rap style, I wrote all the music with sections blocked for verses &amp; choruses while Brian &amp; Jeff would make up the rhymes as they went along. If they fucked up too much, we'd just go back a few bars and fix it. Eventually, we had a handful of decent tunes, and then a whole CD.</p>
    <p>Though <em>Headphones Required</em> was never officially released, or mastered, or sold, it still exists today for your listening pleasure. You can go to their <a href="https://soundclick.com/themietusbros">SoundClick page</a> or go here for <a href="javascript:;" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('mietusPlayer.html','','width=380,height=170')">their player</a>. Currently there are only a few songs from this release available, but I will have more posted soon. Right now you can enjoy such classic titles as, "I Want's Ta Bone Ya All The Way To Fredonia", "Alright", and "Stupid Ass Funky Shit". Oh yes, did I mention that their lyrics are very tongue-in-cheek? Don't take them too seriously, the guys don't.</p>
    <h3>Sexuary</h3>
    <p><strong>Sexuary</strong><br>
    As my debut professional production, <em>Sexuary</em>, is a combination of songs I wrote while in bands in college and songs written in the 2 years after college. The title track is written about a small beach town in Costa Rica named Tomarindo. I visited there twice and fell in love with it. It's a sleepy little town with a great beach and good bars/clubs.</p>
    <p>The track, <em>Higher</em>, is a Hip‑Hop‑ish revamp of an earlier Funk version I used to perform while at Fredonia. My friend Reggie White wrote the original bass line; it was the backbone of the song. It's a song about love and lust and the hope to transcend the physical.</p>
    <p><em>What 'Chu Gonna Do Tonight</em> is one of my favorite grooves. It's an upbeat Funk jam that about boredom, drugs, and down‑to‑Earth-ism. I have many different versions of this song so don't be surprised to see it pop up on a future release from Pharaoh.</p>
    <p>I recorded the album at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210730165703/http://www.outerlimitrecordingstudio.com/">Outer Limit Recording Studio</a> in Buffalo, New York. Another tie to Fredonia is that the studio owner and head engineer, Ken Rutowski attended Fredonia too.</p>
