    <h1>&quot;Barack's Gonna Take Ant's Money&quot;</h1>
    <p><strong><img src="../images/graphics/bgtam_funkship.jpg" alt="Barack Gonna Take Ant's Money" width="200" height="462" class="fltrt">(Otherwise known as the Unraveling of Anthony Cumia)</strong></p>
    <p>Back on November 5th, I was listening to the <a href="http://www.oandaradio.com/">Opie &amp; Anthony Show</a>. Co-host Anthony Cumia, who is not an Obama supporter, claims that once Barack Obama became the President Elect, black people started harassing him. One such case of said harassment was when a black man walked out in front of Cumia's Escalade forcing the high profiled radio star to screech to a halt. When Cumia yelled at the man, the man simply replied, "Obama president naaah!" This of course caused Cumia to lose his mind and rant on the show.</p>
    <p>I started recording the show just as Cumia began losing his marbles verbally. Then I wrote a song about it called <em><strong>Barack Gonna Take Ant's Money</strong></em> (BGTAM), and sent it to the XM studios. A staffer named Derek, from <a href="http://www.foundrymusic.com/">FoundryMusic.com</a>, reviewed the song then sent me an e-mail stating that he liked it and would "pass it along". Apparently he did because on January 27, 2009, the song debuted on the terrestrial side of their radio show. (They broadcast half of their show on regular radio and half on Sirius XM satellite radio.) The next day Opie &amp; Anthony closed their show by playing the uncensored version of BGTAM on the Sirius XM. Since then, the hook of the song has been turned into a sounder which is played once in a while when Cumia starts to dis' Obama.</p>

    <p>Below are links to BGTAM and how it was used on the show.</p>

    <h2>Lyrics <span class="detail">[nsfw]</span></h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Barack gonna take Ant's money<br>
        And give it on up to me</p>
      <p>Now I been listening on the radio<br>
        To what's goin' down on the O &amp; A show<br>
        Obama's got Anthony's knickers in a twist<br>
        Something about the tax and the guns in his fist<br>
        In guessin' and bettin' they gonna take Ant's guns away<br>
        Robbin' the rich for the black man's better day<br>
        That's just crazy if you think for a sec<br>
        Now why the fuck would I want Anthony's check?<br>
        Unless I'm gettin' a Shelby, a chick to smell me<br>
        A sweet radio show, yeah that would sell me<br>
        But am I getting' paid?<br>
        And how!<br>
        Obama President Naaah!</p>
      <p>Barack gonna take Ant's money<br>
        And give it on up to me</p>
      <p>It's the United Negro Cumia Fund<br>
        A chick in every bed and under 21<br>
        So turn in your guns for collard greens<br>
        And your Starbucks for the grape soda machines<br>
        Gonna get me a fire pit to burn shit in<br>
        And Anthony's gonna have to take it on the chin<br>
        I'm bumpin' into cracka's that don't steer clear<br>
        It's the black man's time for terror and fear<br>
        Don't worry 'bout the mortgage or payin' the rent<br>
        Obama's got your back 'cuz he's heaven sent<br>
        And when he's done improving my life<br>
        I'm a have more money that Ant's ex-wife</p>
      <p>Barack gonna take Ant's money<br>
        And give it on up to me</p>
      <p>Hit 'em where it hurts!</p>
      <p>Barack gonna take Ant's money<br>
        And give it on up to me</p>
