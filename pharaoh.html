     <h1>And who is this Pharaoh?</h1>
     <p>Nate Schneekloth, known artistically as Pharaoh, is a Buffalo, NY-based producer, songwriter, and founder of Funkship, blending a lifelong funk/soul journey with cutting-edge musical creation through AI and digital tools.</p>

     <h2>The Early Years</h2>
     <p>Born in 1969, he moved from Madison, WI, to Blacksburg, VA, before settling in Buffalo, where summers at uncle Richard's GlassWing Studio sparked his recording passion—at age 11, he mastered his first blues scale and tracked a debut 1-4-5 groove using cassette loops and his mom's upright piano.</p>

     <h2>High School &amp; CamelHead</h2>
     <p>In high school, he formed CamelHead (formerly Dance &amp; Dining), headlining talent shows and opening for 10,000 Maniacs at the 1987 Riviera Theatre <em>In My Tribe</em> release party; the sound engineer hailed them as "the Talking Heads of Buffalo," with arrangement wisdom from the drummer's father, a University at Buffalo percussion professor.</p>

     <h2>Fredonia &amp; Fred Needs Funk</h2>
     <p>At Fredonia State (class of '93), Pharaoh ignited "Fred Needs Funk," a musical crusade that challenged the campus blues-jam monopoly. Ever-shifting lineups sharpened his adaptable songwriting, and he returned to Buffalo post-grad with grooves locked and loaded.</p>

     <h2>Home Studio Era</h2>
     <p>His home studio era delivered the Mietus Bros hip-hop album and Elliot Scott's <em>Danger Is Here</em>, marrying vintage warmth to precise digital workflows.</p>

     <h2>Funkship Today</h2>
     <p>Today, Funkship.com anchors his musical creation empire: AI labs BeatStew and Funkalizer generate funk/soul riffs and textures trained on his signature sound; @BeatStewMusic shares music across YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok; and Gumroad offers pro creator kits with multitrack stems, custom drum kits, and synth presets. The funk evolution thrives.</p>
